# ML project - Rock vs Mine - SONAR Data
 
Prediction of Rock and Mine using Sonar data. This project was made by using Machine Learning (regression model).

This project aims to use machine learning to help submarines tell the difference between mines and rocks underwater. When submarines explore, they use sonar to scan the ocean floor. Mines are dangerous explosives that can harm the submarine, while rocks are harmless. The project involves creating a system that analyzes sonar data to figure out if an object is a mine or just a rock. This is important for keeping submarines safe in areas where there might be hidden mines. By training a computer model with examples of what the sonar signals look like for both mines and rocks, the system will learn to identify them correctly, making it easier for submarines to avoid danger.
